= Usage =
* The ventral stream model is organized as a hierarchy of layers. 'S' layers consist of feature detectors that provide specificity. 'C' layers provide invariance to position and scale. The level of specificity and invariances increase along the hierarchy. 

= Details =
The code consists of generic S and C layer implementations that can be stacked to generate the hierarchy. In contrast, the original matlab implementation is hard-wired for S1,C1,S2,C2 computation. 

===S Layer===
The code provides different kinds of feature detectors. 
* s_norm_filter : This implements a normalized dot-product with the prototype (used for S1)
* s_rbf         : This provides a gaussian tuning around the prototype (used for S2)
